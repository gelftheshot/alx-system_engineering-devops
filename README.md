# System engineering & Devops

This ripo **System engineering** and **Devops**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/)**.
i learned about **system engineering and Devops** in this ripo and all important file are here.

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies and related to system engineering and devops


ALL projects was completed as part of the curriculum for the ALX-SE programme which is based on the curriculem of [holbertonshool](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) best in the silcon vally. ALX Africa is an online full-stack software engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry using project-based peer learning.
